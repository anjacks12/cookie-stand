### Reflections and Comments

* Day 1: set up the new repo and added extra extensions per class instructions; after that began working on creating object literals for the lab
* Day 2: worked on creating the object literal for the seattle store in the project; I had some difficulty getting the values to loop through but Sheyna, the class instructor, helped me with that; I was reminded that I need to do some more reviewing on loops; wasn't able to finish the lab assignment today but turned in what I had so I could resubmit later
* Day 3: was able to complete the seattle store object literal; had A LOT of difficulty calculating the total number of cookies sold, I just couldn't seem to get my head wrapped around how to do it but thankfully Sheyna was very patient with me and helped me get to the solution; I had been meaning to go back and review how functions carryover values, like in the summation and multiplication exercises we did but didn't get a chance to; lesson for today: review, review, review
* Day 4: finished the lab and included all 5 store locations; to do this, it was pretty much a lot of cutting and pasting, and changing the respective min/max and average cookie values
* Day 5: started working on adding font styles to the index.html and style.css; practice a bit on making a simple table on index.html
* Dat 6: finished the lab but think the code looks messy; tried to use a nested for loop to get the hourly total of cookies sold in the table below but couldn't get that to work so ended up getting the result the "long" way [^1]
* Day 7: cleaned up JS file and added some comments for future reference; styled the table to make it look a bit more presentable
* Day 8: added total cookies sold at each store on the table below; I had forgotten to add that yesterday; adjusted to for loops to get the nested for loops to work, still had to get the results the "long way" but at least the index numbers were easier to keep track of!
* Day 9: started styling the index.html for the public-facing page for the lab[^2]
* Day 10: cleaned up CSS code a bit and turned in lab
* Day 11: added a form to the page that used the information collected to create a new store [^3]; I have to go back and rework a lot of code to be able to remove the rendered list and leave only the form and table on the page; created a pull request for the working code now just in case I end up "lost" in re-working the code
