### Reflections and Comments

* Day 1: set up the new repo and added extra extensions per class instructions; after that began working on creating object literals for the lab
* Day 2: worked on creating the object literal for the seattle store in the project; I had some difficulty getting the values to loop through but Sheyna, the class instructor, helped me with that; I was reminded that I need to do some more reviewing on loops; wasn't able to finish the lab assignment today but turned in what I had so I could resubmit later
* Day 3: was able to complete the seattle store object literal; had A LOT of difficulty calculating the total number of cookies sold, I just couldn't seem to get my head wrapped around how to do it but thankfully Sheyna was very patient with me and helped me get to the solution; I had been meaning to go back and review how functions carryover values, like in the summation and multiplication exercises we did but didn't get a chance to; lesson for today: review, review, review
* Day 4: finished the lab and included all 5 store locations; to do this, it was pretty much a lot of cutting and pasting, and changing the respective min/max and average cookie values
* Day 5: started working on adding font styles to the index.html and style.css; practice a bit on making a simple table on index.html
